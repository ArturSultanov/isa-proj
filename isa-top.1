.SH SYNOPSIS
.B isa-top
\-i \fIinterface\fR
[\-s \fBb\fR|\fBp\fR] [\-t \fIinterval\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B isa-top
is a command-line tool that captures and displays real-time transfer rates (bytes/second and packets/second) between communicating IP addresses on a specified network interface. It uses 
.I libpcap 
for packet capture and 
.I ncurses 
for terminal display, providing an updated view every second or at a user-defined interval.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-i \fIinterface\fR
Specify the network interface to listen on. This option is required.
.TP
.B \-s \fBb\fR|\fBp\fR
Sort the displayed connections by either bytes per second (\fBb\fR) or packets per second (\fBp\fR). Default is sorting by bytes.
.TP
.B \-t \fIinterval\fR
Set the update interval (in seconds). Default is 1 second.

.SH EXAMPLES
To monitor traffic on the interface \fBeth0\fR and sort by bytes per second:
.PP
.nf
.RS
isa-top \-i eth0 \-s b
.RE
.fi
.PP
To monitor traffic on the interface \fBwlan0\fR with an update interval of 2 seconds:
.PP
.nf
.RS
isa-top \-i wlan0 \-t 2
.RE
.fi

.SH OUTPUT
The output displays the following columns:
.TP
.B Src IP:port
The source IP address and port of the connection.
.TP
.B Dst IP:port
The destination IP address and port of the connection.
.TP
.B Proto
The protocol used (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
.TP
.B Rx b/s, p/s
Received bytes per second and packets per second.
.TP
.B Tx b/s, p/s
Transmitted bytes per second and packets per second.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The behavior of 
.B isa-top
may be influenced by the following environment variables:
.TP
.B PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE
Sets the size of the buffer for error messages from 
.I libpcap.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /usr/local/bin/isa-top
The location where the executable may be installed.
.TP
.I /etc/isa-top.conf
Optional configuration file for default settings.
